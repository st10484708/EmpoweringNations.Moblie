Project Overview

This is a mobile application developed as part of a practical project in the Work Integrated Learning subject. The app was built using React Native (TypeScript) and styled with CSS-in-JS to maintain consistency with the website’s design.

The Empowering the Nation Mobile App serves as an educational and community-focused platform designed to showcase a variety of short and long courses offered to learners across South Africa.

It provides users with an easy-to-use, responsive interface to explore course information, contact details, motivational quotes, and other features aligned with the organisation’s mission of empowerment and lifelong learning.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the POE, which includes creating a functional, user-friendly, and accessible mobile solution that mirrors the design and purpose of the Empowering the Nation website.

Purpose and Features
Purpose:

The Empowering the Nation Mobile App aims to serve as an accessible digital learning companion that promotes skill development and personal growth. It connects users to short and long training programmes in domestic, vocational, and technical fields — empowering them to improve employability and self-reliance.

The app allows users to:

Explore course categories and details.

View motivational content that encourages lifelong learning.

Access contact details for both Johannesburg (JNB) and Cape Town (CPT) centres.

Experience a clean, mobile-first interface optimized for both Android and iOS.

By providing a user-friendly experience, the app supports the vision of building a skilled, confident, and empowered South African community.

Design Considerations

The design of the Empowering the Nation Mobile App was based on the following principles:

User Experience (UX): Prioritized intuitive navigation and visually clear content to enhance accessibility and user satisfaction.

Responsiveness: Ensured compatibility across a wide range of Android screen sizes and resolutions.

Simplicity: Maintained a clean and minimal design, focusing on usability and clarity.

Performance: Optimized assets, navigation, and components for smooth performance and reduced load times.

Design Consistency:

Used a consistent color palette and typography across all screens.

Followed the website’s design elements for visual harmony.

Ensured that all UI elements, from buttons to cards, follow a unified style guide.

App Structure

Home Screen: Displays the organisation’s mission and introduction.
Courses Screen: Divided into two categories — 6-Week Short Courses and 6-Month Long Courses.
Individual Course Screens: Each course (Gardening, Cooking, Child Minding, Sewing, etc.) includes details such as syllabus, outcomes, and duration.
Quote Screen: Displays motivational quotes that align with the theme of empowerment.
Contact Screen: Shows official contact details for Johannesburg and Cape Town offices.
